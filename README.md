# Forest_Fire_prediction_using_Python_(ML)
•	What is Forest Fire, and what does this project mean?
An unplanned, uncontrolled burning or combustion of vegetation in a natural environment, like a forest, grassland, etc., is referred to as a forest, bush, wild, or vegetarian fire. The goal of this study is to estimate the probability of a forest fire based on certain features, not to determine if one will occur or not.
 
•	Why do we need a forest fire prediction model?
So, the first issue is, why is machine learning even necessary to forecast forest fires in that specific area? Therefore, the question of why machine learning (ML) is necessary even with an experienced forest department that has been handling these issues for a long time is valid. The answer is straight forward: while an experienced forest department can check on three to four parameters using their human minds, ML can handle a wide range of parameters, including latitude, longitude, satellite, version, and other variables. Because of this multi-relationship of a parameter that is responsible for the forest fire, ML is definitely necessary!
